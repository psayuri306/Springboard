# Big Mountain Resort Problem Statement

How should Big Mountain Resort choose a better value ticket price by the end of the year without undermining the ticket price. 
What's the highest price we can support so that it can support the 1.5mil additional cost?

## Context

Big Mountain Resort is a very popular ski resort where up to 350,000 will visit their slopes that are suitable for all skill levels. The resort installed an additional lift to increase distribution across the mountain but adding so increased operating costs by $1,540,000. 
Big Mountain charges a premium above the average of other resorts but this doesnâ€™t tell them how important some facilities are compared to others. Some facilities could charge a higher ticket price than others, ranked on importance. 
Ticket prices at a typical ski resort varies based on whether a skier/snowboarder wants rentals, and whether they use just the beginner ski area or all of the slopes. Tickets almost always are higher on the weekends and cheaper during the weekdays. Resorts will also have discounts for certain block periods, like half-off from 4pm-closing time. Ticket prices can also spike during traditionally peak times, like winter break, christmas time, etc. Prices can easily vary between eastern state resorts and western state resorts. 
A resort could be higher end if the elevation is higher, has more chair lifts, more snow blowers, and has more slopes to maintain. Operational costs for a high-end resort could be lowered by reducing the runs or terrain parks that are the least utilized, invest in more efficient snow blowers or reduce the numbers, and optimize chair lift operations. 


## Criteria For Success

Success will be measured by reducing costs by the end of the year and coming up with a new ticket price. 
Cover 1.5mil of additional operating cost

## Scope of Solution Space

Reduction of costs will be focused on equipment and operations.  
Best max ticket (price increase) supportable. And optimize facilities. 

## Constraints Within the Solution Space

Not having enough data in the dataset - it would be useful to have data about how many people visit these resorts or even how many buy season passes in order to look at demand trends. Also useful to know how many resorts are within a 25 to 50 mile radius of one resort.  
Would management agree with the price increase? Have to provide evidence to support that, since they're already skeptical about the premium prices.
